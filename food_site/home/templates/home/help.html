	<p>Welcome to the Help page! Navigating our site is actually quite simple. For some tips and tricks, please look below:</p>
	<div class="table">
	<ul>
	<li>In order to sort the data columns, simply click the title of the column. Click it again to reverse the sorting!</li>
	<li>If the data is not visible, you might not be logged in. If this is the case, the return button leads to the login screen!</li>
	<li>While all authenticated users are able to view the data, only admin users have the ability to manipulate it.</li>
	<li>You must be authenticated to visit the manufacturing page. This is because each manufacturing goal is private to every user, and can only be viewed and exported by the user who created it.</li>
	<li>On the manufacturing page, when selecting SKUs to place in a manufacturing goal, you can also filter those SKUs by product line using the first field in each row of the form.</li>
	<li>On the manufacturing page, when selecting SKUs to place in a manufacturing goal, you can type in the first letter of a desired SKU name to skip to that letter alphabetically on the list.</li>
	<li>You can add additional rows to the table to submit as SKUs for the manufacturing goal. Be advised that the maximum number of submittable SKUs for one goal is 1000.</li>
	<li>If you fill one field on a row in the form, you must fill all of the fields for that row or else the form will not allow submission. HOWEVER, you do not need to fill every row of the form in order to submit the form.</li>
	<li>Once a goal has been saved, its data can be viewed and exported through the site. A calculation of ingredient package quantity for a given goal can also be generated, viewed, and exported on the site.</li>
